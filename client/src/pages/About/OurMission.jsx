      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        At GlobalYogaSpace, we’re dedicated to bringing authentic yoga into real life—making it personal, practical, and open to everyone, no matter where they are. We believe that lasting wellbeing comes from balance: the harmony of body, breath, and mind working together.

      <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Our goal is to combine the depth of traditional yoga with the ease of modern technology. Through live, private sessions with skilled instructors, you can receive tailored guidance right from your home. This isn’t just exercise—it’s a meaningful, lifelong practice designed to strengthen your body, support your mental health, and nurture your overall wellbeing.
